In this video, you will learn how to get your API credentials.
0:08
All Yuno API requests require API credentials to verify the call is being
0:12
made through a valid Yuno account.
0:14
You can interact with the Yuno API using the Sandbox and
0:16
the Production environments.
0:18
Sandbox is a test environment while Production is the live mode.
0:22
To access these environments, the authentication process is
0:25
the same, but you need different credentials to each one of them.
0:28
After creating your Yuno account, you immediatelly have access
0:31
to the Sandbox credentials.
0:33
The production credentials will be generated after activating your account.
0:37
To access your sandbox credentials, first go to the Yuno dashboard.
0:41
After that, click on the Developers tab on the left panel to access
0:44
your Sandbox API credentials.
0:47
On the Developers page, you will find the public-api-key,
0:50
private-secret-key and the account-code.
0:53
These are used to authenticate your requests to the Yuno API.
0:56
Now to access the Production credentials, go to the Yuno dashboard
1:00
and turn the test mode off using the toggle switch at the top of the page.
1:04
When you do this, your status will change to active status, indicating that you
1:07
can access your Production credentials.
1:11
Here we are using an account that is not activated but the process to find the
1:14
production credentials is the same as described for the sandbox credentials.
1:18
The Production credentials are different from the sandbox credentials we accessed
1:21
earlier, but they have the same name
