Activation of functionality:              There are many restrictions for international cards due to fraud prevention. Flexibility can be requested for certain merchants. However, payment approval, even with the flex engine, is very low due to bank rejection.

In this service, use your Mercado Pago account to complete the transaction. The following image shows the page the user will be redirected to:  For additional information, refer to the Mercado Pago documentation. However, as a summary, you need to follow the next steps:   Create test users to use as a seller and as a customer while developing the integration. Mercado Pago uses these test users to replicate the production environment, and they can only interact with other test users. If you use a real account to pay a checkout created by a test user, you will receive an error message (invalid_users_involved).  📘Tips Always check if you are logged in with a real account before completing a payment. You SHOULD NOT use a real account to perform tests. Add account money to the test user account while creating it.   Get your API credentials and set them on Yuno´s dashboard while creating the payment method. If you do not have an application started yet, create one following to get your API keys. Both for enrollments with MercadoPago Wallet or payments with the Mercado Pago Checkout Pro, use the account money available for the test user or test cards provided by Mercado Pago to make a payment.  After creating your Mercado Pago user and performing the payment, you can use the Retrieve Payment by ID to check the payment status. If everything goes correctly, the Retrieve Payment by ID response will have a SUCCEEDED payment.status and a APPROVED payment.sub_status. Integration configuration       Credentials and steps to obtain them:              They can be found in the Dashboard or in your Mercado Pago account by accessing to Your Business > Settings >             Management and Administration > Credentials.                          Test credentials: Public Key, Access Token              Production credentials: Public Key, Access Token, Client ID, Client Secret    Dashboard configuration:   Log in to dashboard.y.uno. Click Connections and then select Mercado Pago. Click Connect. Introduce Name and Country Select Mercado Pago Checkout Pro as Payment Method Introduce the Access Token Configure Settings Click Connect     Configuration of webhooks in partner:  Via dashboard:              Create an application on the homepage of your Dashboard. With the application created, go to the Webhook Notifications tab in your Dashboard and configure the production and test URLs from which notifications will be received. You will also be able to experiment and test if the indicated URL is receiving notifications correctly, being able to check the request, the response given by the server and the description of the event. If you need to identify multiple accounts, at the end of the indicated URL you can indicate the                 parameter ?customer=(sellername) endpoint to identify the sellers. Next, select the events for which you will receive notifications in json format via HTTP POST to the URL specified above. An event is any type of update to the reported object, including state or attribute changes.  Setup while creating payments:              In the notification_url field, indicate the URL from which notifications will be received. Implement the notifications receiver.  If you want to receive notifications only from Webhook and not from IPN, you can add in the               notification_url the parameter source_news=webhook. For example:                  https://www.yourserver.com/notifications?source_news=webhooks   Note: When you receive a notification on your platform, Mercado Pago expects a response to validate that you received it correctly. To do so, it must return a HTTP STATUS 200 (OK) or 201 (CREADO). If this response is not sent, it will be understood that you have not received the notification and a further attempt to send it will be made until you submit the response.       Production environment      Specific procedure for a merchant to go live:              If the merchant is part of a group of corporations that Mercado Pago follows up on a timely basis, a call should be made to validate the integration, review test payments in the Mercado Pago system, think about a progressive implementation method, etc.                                                          Send feedback           Updated 20 days ago Table of Contents  Connecting with Yuno   General information   Captures   Refunds   Voids   Installments   Chargebacks   Security   Testing guidelines for sandbox environment  Testing steps    Integration configuration   Production environment
