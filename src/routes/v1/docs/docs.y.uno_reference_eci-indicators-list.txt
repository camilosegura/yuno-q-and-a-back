It helps merchants determine the next steps to take in a transaction â€” proceed, reject the purchase, or try again. Below you will find the possible responses and ECI values you can receive. Successful authentication The card issuer has successfully verified the cardholder's identity and validated the EMV 3Ds protocol. Consequently, the transaction is authorized to proceed, and all parties can benefit from the security and safeguards provided by 3DS.
