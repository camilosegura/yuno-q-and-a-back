After getting the customer session information with Yuno's SDK, you'll need to send us that id in order to verify the transaction. If the transaction does not need a challenge, we'll continue with the payment, but if it does, we'll return a redirect_url for you to redirect your customer to the bank environment and complete the challenge.  Once the challenge is completed, the user will be returned to the callback_url set on the payment and we'll send you a webhook to notify the result of it and the final status of the payment.LanguageShellNodeRubyPHPPythonAuthorizationHeader +2RESPONSEClick Try It! to start a request and see the response here!
