Status Verify
 
Question: 
What does the "status verify" mean?
 
Answer: 
"Verify" is a specific type of transaction used to check whether a card is valid or not without processing a charge or authorization as such, which means it does not involve an amount when verifying the card's validity.


Payment Creation Notification 


Question:
Which status corresponds to the notification of payment creation?


Answer: 
There is no event that notifies the creation of the payment. What is actually notified is when the payment changes its status. For example, when the payment is created and remains in a "pending" status, we notify the final result of it. Similarly, if the payment is refunded, we also provide a notification.


Notificación Pending


Question:
What status notifies a transaction that is created and in "pending"?

Answer: 
In the case that you always use transactions of the "purchase" type, with the option selected, we will notify all events related to "purchases." Currently, when the payment is in the "pending" status, we do not send a webhook; we send it when the payment reaches a final status, whether it's "approved," "rejected," or "expired."


 Multiple Order IDs
 
Question:
 Another thing, I see that there is duplication of our order IDs with different Payment IDs, different transaction provider IDs, and different statuses. Which one should we consider? Is this a bug on your end?
 
Answer:
Regarding these cases, we have a race condition that is allowing payments to be processed with the same Checkout ID - Order ID but with different Idempotency Keys. To prevent this behavior, it is necessary to ensure that the Idempotency Key is always the same.


Support Email
 
Question:
What is the support email?
 
Answer:
For support, you can contact support@y.uno.
 
Dashboard Invitation Error


Question:
Why can't I send more than one invite by email for the dashboard?
 
Answer:
When you invite someone, that invitation has a lifespan of up to 6 days. When the invitation expires without being accepted, it becomes inactive and won't appear on the dashboard. If you wish to re-invite the person (as you attempted to do this time), you can do so.
 
Idempotency
 
Question:
Does the X-idempotency-key header refer to the account code, or where can I find it?


Answer:
"Our API supports idempotency keys to avoid duplicate request processing in case of multiple repetitions of the same operation. This feature is useful when a request fails due to a communication error and you have not received a conclusive answer. If you receive a connection error on a given call, you can simply reattempt a new request using the same idempotency key. This way, our API can guarantee that the second call will not be processed in duplicity."


Production Credentials
 
Question:
If we want to test in production, what is the process for production API keys? Do you generate them, or what should we do?
 
Answer:
Once your account is active in production, you can go to the developers section from the dashboard and obtain the production credentials in the same way as you did for sandbox. Just make sure that the "test" button at the top of the screen is deactivated.






Account Activation
 
Question:
How do I activate my account?
 
Answer:
To activate your account, you should log in to the dashboard and on the homepage, you'll find the "activate account" option. We will take care of the activation process internally. If you have any questions, please contact the support team.
 
Payment Expiration
 
Question:
After a certain period of non-payment by the user, will the payment be canceled?
 
Answer:
Yes, the time it takes for this to happen depends on each specific payment method or provider.
 
Documentation
 
Question:
Where can I find Yuno's documentation?
 
Answer:

PCI Compliance
 
Question:
Do we need to be PCI Compliance to integrate with Yuno?
 
Answer:
There is no PCI Compliance requirement on Yuno's side; we are already PCI certified. The only requirement would be to ensure a secure integration, either through the SDK FULL, Lite, or Secure Fields. More information can be found at: https://docs.y.uno/docs/pci-compliance.

SDK Documentation 

Question:
Where can I find the SDK documentation?
How do I implement the Yuno SDK?


Answer:
For recurring payments, we do not have a specific SDK, but it's quite straightforward. You need to create a payment via the API(https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment)
There are integration and tokenization flows for each payment method,
SDK Full
SDK Lite
Secure Fields


Enrollment


Question:
Is there any chance we could save Customer's bank card number/token on our side to use it for future purchases?`
Answer:
Yes, you can save customer’s card using the vaulted token that Yuno’s system return to your system after the enrollment process. You can use this vaulted token to future purchases.


Question:
If I understand correctly, after payment method has been chosen and enrolled by a user, we must take vaulted_token via webhook and create a payment with that, right? So this is only one way to make a payment with already enrolled method?


Answer:
You can receive the vaulted token via webhook and you can store it, so you can, after that, create purchases via back to back using this vaulted token: https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment or you can use always the SDK to get the available payment methods for a customer.


Question:
Is there any examples how checkout process will be look like with enrolled bank card payment method?


Answer:
Give me a little time and I’ll send you some screenshots about how a checkout with enrolled payment methods looks.

How to set up a redirect button on the status page after a successful/unsuccessful deposit and style it?


Answer:
Callback_url parameter in Create payment method
https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment


Question
How Yuno will pass the vaulted_token method to our service? From webhook?


Answer:
Create the customer or you can use one previous created customer.
Generate the customer session, via backend.
Do the get to GET/checkout/sessions/{{checkout_session}}/payment-methods. This is going to give you the available payments methods for that customer.
Display the payment methods to your customer.
Enroll the payment method using the endpoint POST/customers/payment-methods..
Start enrollment SDK.
Receive the webhook that includes the vaulted token.


Question
What is the difference between the Full SDK and Lite SDK?
 
Answer
The Full SDK handles the checkout user interface (excluding payment processing) by displaying all available payment methods, whereas the SDK Lite works similarly but does not display the payment methods. However, if any data is missing, create a form to capture it.
