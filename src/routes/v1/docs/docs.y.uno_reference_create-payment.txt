Important   				There are certain objects that are not mandatory when creating a "Payment". However, if you provide this information, the user’s payment experience will be enhanced. Be aware of the mandatory fields if you wish to provide this information.                  3DS Payments             To understand how 3D Secure payments work, check the 3D Secure page or the Direct Workflow guide to learn how to create payments using 3DS on Yuno.              If you want to process payments in a Single Step (Authorization and Capture simultaneously), you need to send the capture attribute as true, so the payment is captured automatically. In Sandbox, all Card payments are automatically approved by default while using the Yuno Testing Gateway as a provider in your CARD route. If you want to test the response of all possible errors, you can include the “response_code” that you want the payment to result in the “description” body parameter of the Create a Payment On the other hand, if you wish to process the payment in Two Steps (First Authorization and then Capture) you need to send this attribute as false. Please follow the steps below to implement a two-step flow:  Create an authorization using the Authorize Payment request. Capture the created authorization using the Capture Authorization request.  Note that this request requires an X-Idempotency-Key. Check the Authentication page for more information.
