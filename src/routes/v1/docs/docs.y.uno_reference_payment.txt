Workflow In the following workflow, you can find the different payment statuses and how they can be updated.   For every implementation, we recommend taking the payment status and sub_status as the main reference for the payment's state. A payment could have different transactions associated to it, so by focusing on the payment status/sub_status, you can have the latest state regardless of how many transactions were made, giving you a clear input for decision making.
