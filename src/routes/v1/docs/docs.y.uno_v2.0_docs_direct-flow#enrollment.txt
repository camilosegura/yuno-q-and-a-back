Your company must be PCI certified to use our server-to-server card payments service. Please forward your AOC certification to your account manager prior to beginning the implementation. For every implementation, we recommend taking the payment status and sub_status as the main reference for the payment's state. A payment could have different transactions associated to it, so by focusing on the payment status/sub_status, you can have the latest state regardless of how many transactions were made, giving you a clear input for decision making. With this integration you can also enroll credit cards for future purchases (also only available for PCI compliant merchants).  Payment    Step 1: Create a customer [Optional] - The fist step of the payment flow is to create a customer. A customer will have payment methods associated, this is why it is important. You can create a customer using the following endpoint. As a result you will receive the id of the customer that was created in the Yuno DB. If you have created the customer that is going to pay previously you can skip this step. This step is optional because you can send the customer information directly in the payment without creating a customer object in Yuno.  Step 2: Create the payment As you take care of the whole payment experience with this integration, you will need to display the payment methods enabled in your Yuno account, and once the user has selected the payment method you will be able to create a payment. A payment gathers all crucial details regarding the order, customer specifics, total amount, currency, products, shipping details, and more. You can create a Payment using the following endpoint. You can use the examples section in the API reference as a reference and in case the user selects a previously enrolled payment method, you can use the vaulted_token returned by the get payment methods service to create the payment. During the integration, we recommend taking the payment status and sub_status as the main reference for the payment's state. A payment could have different transactions associated to it, so by focusing on the payment status/sub_status, you can have the latest state regardless of how many transactions were made, giving you a clear input for decision making. Complementary features  Webhooks: We also recommend configuring Webhooks in your Yuno dashboard. Webhooks are the best way to ensure your system is up-to-date with payment progress and status. Since the event notifications trigger automatically, your system won't need to perform recurrent requests to Yuno   Enrollment    Step 1: Create a customer The fist step of the payment flow is to create a customer.

As a result you will receive the id of the customer that was created in the Yuno DB.  If you have created the customer that is going to pay previously you can skip this step. Step 2: Enroll payment method                 This feature is only available for enrolling Cards for PCI compliant merchants              Once you have your customer, you can enroll the payment method by just using the Enroll Payment Method endpoint . With the information provided by Yuno after the customer selects the payment method to enroll, you will be able to save that information for future purchases using the vaulted_token that represents the payment method object created.Updated 26 days ago Table of Contents  How it works   Payment  Step 1: Create a customer Step 2: Create the payment Complementary features    Enrollment  Step 1: Create a customer Step 2: Enroll payment method
