Why choosing the right integration is important? The type of integration you choose is important because it is going to impact your business in several aspects:  Integration and maintenance effort: the type of integration defines the time you are going to take building the integration and also the level of maintenance you will need to give it. The effort to add and manage payment methods: depending on the integration you implement, the effort to add or manage payment methods will vary. Our most complete solution allows you to add and manage payment methods from our dashboard with no code. However, other implementations could need some work from your development team. Compliance requirements: some implementations require a level of compliance, like PCI-DSS certifications or ISO certifications, to work. In order to use these integrations, you will need to provide these certifications to Yuno.  Types of integration At Yuno, we have 5 types of integrations. Below, you can see the all the specifications for each of them.      Feature SDK Full SDK Lite Secure fields Direct Plugins     Add new payment methods without code                       Handle hundreds of payment methods with a single API                       Tokenize cards and payment methods without code                       Use Yuno's PCI-DSS Certification                       Use 3D Secure                       Use an antifraud solution without code                       Set checkout conditions using our dashboard                       Customize the look and feel of your checkout using our dashboard                        Full SDK This alternative is the most complete solution that we have. Using our Full SDK, you can integrate Yuno, minimizing integration, maintenance, and operational efforts, with no need for any compliance requirement. With the Full SDK, Yuno handles the user experience and allows you to customize the checkout and payment methods you are showing to your users from our dashboard. This gives you a lot of flexibility and reduces the need to write more code in the future when you add new payment methods and features to your payment stack. Lite SDK With the Lite SDK implementation you have full control of your checkout frontend. Yuno will provide your backend with all the available payment methods you can offer to your clients. With this information you can decide which payments methods you want to show in you checkout. Secure Fields Secure Fields creates a seamless and secure checkout flow on your website or app. With a set of prebuilt UI components available for Web, Android, and iOS, Secure Fields simplifies the process of collecting and tokenizing sensitive payment card details.  Direct Flow Besides our SDK integrations, we allow merchants to connect directly to Yuno's APIs to process payments in case you have specific requirements that need to be addressed with a back-to-implementation. Your company must be PCI certified to use our server-to-server card payments service, and we will require you to forward your AOC certification to your account manager prior to beginning the implementation. Although our main features are not available in this type of integration, you still have access to our standardized API to handle hundreds of payment methods and tools with just one API. Plugins The most important benefit of plugin integrations is the easiness of the implementation. Just with a few clicks and configuration, you can have our solution. The most evident disadvantage is that the availability of Yuno's features depends on the platform, and some features could not be available. Currently, we support a plugin integration with the VTEX platform.
