Yuno uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. 
Codes in the 2xx range usually indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that occurred based on the information provided (e.g., a missing parameter, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an internal error.
Example
JSON{
  "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
  "messages": [
    "Invalid request."
  ]
}
