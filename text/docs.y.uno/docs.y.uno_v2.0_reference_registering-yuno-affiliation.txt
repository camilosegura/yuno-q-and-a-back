Below you find a step-by-step guide on how to register the affiliation.


Log into your VTEX store account.


In the VTEX Admin, navigate to Store Settings > Payment > Settings. Alternatively, you can use the search bar at the top of the page and type Settings to find it.


Select the Gateway Affiliations tab, then click the + button to add a new affiliation.






You will see a list of plugins. Locate the Yuno plugin and click on it.





On the new page, enter the necessary information for the affiliation. We recommend using "Yuno" as the affiliation name. Fill in the VTEX account details (Application Key and Application Token) as well as the Yuno account details (Account ID, Public API Key, and Secret API Key). Check the Get your credentials guide to learn how to access your account details. For Payment settlement, we recommend you select Use Recommended Payment Processor Behavior.





Once you have entered all the required information, click on the Save button to save the affiliation.

After registering the Yuno plugin affiliation, you can proceed to configure the payment methods that will be processed by Yuno. Check the Configuring payment conditions section to learn how to add payment options to your VTEX account using Yuno.
