The term "Customer" refers to an individual who is part of a merchant's payment network in Yuno and can make payments and store payment methods. This term is closely related to phrases used in the banking and payment sectors, such as "Cardholder" and "Account holder". Each customer has their information associated with them and  we use it to process payments for different payment methods and processors.
Payment methods
Customers can also have enrolled payment methods, which are specific instances of payment methods, including cards or alternative payment methods. Storing payment methods for a customer enables a frictionless payment experience and allows recurring payments without asking for additional information.
For more detailed information on how to use the customers endpoint, pleas refer to the API reference.Table of Contents
