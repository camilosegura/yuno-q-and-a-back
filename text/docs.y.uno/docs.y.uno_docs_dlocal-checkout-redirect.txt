Testing guidelines for sandbox environment





Necessary fields for testing:

            X-Login, X-Trans-Key and Secret Key.
          


Limitations/Specifications for testing:

            You can test payments using the Create a Payment API method, just remember to use the https://sandbox.dlocal.com/payments endpoint.
            In Sandbox, all Credit Card payments are automatically approved by default. If you want to test the response of all possible errors, you can do so with the following trick exclusive for sandbox:

On the description body parameter of the Create a payment you can include the error code that you want the payment to result to.
For example, description: ‚Äú302‚Äù will result in the payment being rejected with the error: ‚ÄúInsufficient Amount‚Äù.
You can check the full list of codes available whenever you need.

Production environment





Specific procedure for a merchant to go live:

           Make a connection test to validate that the IPs are configured correctly performing a GET at the endpoint of payment methods. Additionally, it is recommended to make a satisfactory test in each country to go live. Some PSP go one step further and test for main brand: Amex, Visa and Master.
