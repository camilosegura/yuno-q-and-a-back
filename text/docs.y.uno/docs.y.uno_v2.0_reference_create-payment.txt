3DS Payments


          To understand how 3D Secure payments work, check the 3D Secure page or the Direct Workflow guide to learn how to create payments using 3DS on Yuno.
        




If you want to process payments in a Single Step (Authorization and Capture simultaneously), you need to send the capture attribute as true, so the payment is captured automatically.
On the other hand, if you wish to process the payment in Two Steps (First Authorization and then Capture) you need to send this attribute as false. Please follow the steps below to implement a two-step flow:

Create an authorization using the Authorize Payment request.
Capture the created authorization using the Capture Authorization request.

Note that this request requires an X-Idempotency-Key. Check the Authentication page for more information.
