TRX limit:

            No, but it is important to inform the estimated volumes of a new integration in order to warn about the
            dimensioning to the tech teams, if necessary.
          


Support of international BIN:

            Yes, supported for international credit and debit cards. The shopper pays the product's price on the sellers
            currency, and the conversion is done by the financial institution responsible for issuing the payment (the
            seller always recieves the financial transaction in the currency registered on their Mercado Pago account).
          


Activation of functionality:

            There are many restrictions for international cards due to fraud prevention. Flexibilization for certain
            seller can be requested. Nevertheless, payment approval, even with the flexible motor, is very low due to
            bank rejection.

Testing steps

The Mercado Pago Wallet Connect works as an enrolled payment method. Therefore, you will need to start enrolling it before making a payment.
To make a payment using the Mercado Pago Wallet Connect, you should follow the steps:

Create Customer
Create Customer Session
Retrieve Payment Methods Available (Optional)
Enroll Payment Method
Retrieve Payment Method by Customer Session

The response provides a redirect URL (provider.redirect.init_url), so the user can enroll in the payment method using the Mercado Pago service. 
After the login, the user will be requested to connect a new payment method or use cash.
The user should add credit card info to add a secondary payment method. 
By selecting the cash option, the connection is performed directly. 
For additional information, refer to the Mercado Pago documentation. However, as a summary, you basically need to follow the next steps:

Create test users to use as a seller and as a customer while developing the integration. Mercado Pago uses these test users to replicate the production environment, and they can only interact with other test users. If you use a real account to pay a checkout created by a test user, you will receive an error message (invalid_users_involved).
Get your API credentials and set them on Yuno´s dashboard while creating the payment method. If you do not have an application started yet, create one following to get your API keys.
Both for enrollments with MercadoPago Wallet Connect or payments with the Mercado Pago Checkout Pro, use the account money available for the test user or test cards provided by Mercado Pago to make a payment.









Tips



            Always check if you are logged in with a real account before completing a payment. You SHOULD NOT use a real account to perform tests.
          

            Add account money to the test user account while creating it.
          






Create Checkout Session
Retrieve Payment Methods Available for Checkout to get the vaulted_token related to the payment enrolled before.
Create Payment using the vaulted_token from the last step.

Integration configuration






Credentials and steps to obtain them:

            They can be found on the Dashboard or in your Mercado Pago account by accessing Your Business > Settings >
            Management and Administration > Credentials.
            
            Test credentials: Public Key, Access Token

            Production credentials: Public Key, Access Token, Client ID, Client Secret



Dashboard configuration:


Log in to dashboard.y.uno.
Click Connections and then select Mercado Pago.
Click Connect.
Introduce Name and Country
Select Mercado Pago Wallet Connect as Payment Method
Introduce the Access Token
Configure Settings
Click Connect




Configuration of webhooks in partner:

Via dashboard:
            
Create an application on the homepage of your Dashboard.
With the application created, go to the Webhooks Notifications tab in your Dashboard and configure the
                URLs of production and test from which notifications will be received.
You will also be able to experiment and test if the indicated URL is receiving notifications
                correctly, being able to verify the request, the response given by the server and the description of the
                event.
If you need to identify multiple accounts, at the end of the indicated URL you can indicate the
                parameter ?customer=(sellername) endpoint to identify the sellers.
Next, select the events from which you will receive notifications in json format via an HTTP POST to
                the URL specified above. An event is any type of update to the reported object, including status or
                attribute changes. See the events that can be configured in the table below.







Production environment





Specific procedure for a merchant to go live:

            If the merchant is part of a group of corporations that Mercado Pago follows-up punctually, a call to
            validate the integration should be made, the test payments in Mercado Pago's system should ve revised,
            thinking on a progressive roll-out method, etc.
