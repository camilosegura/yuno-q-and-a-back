This process involves the generation of a new token for each card.




First step


					To initiate the token migration process, contact your business advisor at Yuno to assess the viability and schedule of the procedure.
        




Importing cards from a gateway account
The token migration process deals with confidential information. Therefore, a secure procedure needs to be followed. To import card data to Yuno from an existing gateway, you need to follow these steps:

First, you will communicate with your existing third-party vault/gateway, requesting an export of the payment method data. Follow their specified process and protocols.
Review the data format received from the third-party vault/gateway. The data provided to Yuno must follow a specific data format to perform the migration successfully. 
Submit a formal request to Yuno, providing the environment key where the data will be imported following Yuno's data transfer procedures. The gateway's process and response to the export request will determine the data transfer process.

If the gateway requires SFTP setup for the transfer, our PGP key will be shared with them to obtain the necessary credentials. (Note: S/MIME encryption with an RSA key of at least 2048 bits will be used.)
If Yuno's SFTP is preferred, we will request the public PGP key of the third-party vault/gateway. The key will encrypt credentials for a Yuno-created SFTP server, where the gateway can drop the exported payment methods for us to retrieve. Ideally, the public PGP key of the gateway should be hosted on a publicly accessible page.







Your responsibilities when migrating tokens


					You are responsible for managing communication with your gateway provider throughout the migration process. The Yuno team will support and collaborate directly with the third-party vault/gateway to facilitate the importing process. However, you need to manage the process.
          
          In addition, the customer subscription information, including amounts, dates, etc., must be obtained directly from the exporting entity, as Yuno will not extract this data from encrypted files.
        




The last step is to execute the migration. At this point, you will provide the user's data (the buyers) and their existing payment methods. Before continuing, you need to choose how to migrate the tokens to  Yuno. 
Migration options
You can choose between two options to execute the token migration process. 

Via API: Use the Yuno API to add customers and enroll payment methods to them. 
Via Batch File: Provide customers' data through CSV files to Yuno's team, which will add the customers and enroll payment methods to them. Yuno will provide a new CSV file with additional data for each customer created at the end of the process.

Access the step-by-step guide for each option using the buttons below:

Data format
Yuno defines a list of the required parameters for each customer and credit card to proceed with the migration process. The list of the required parameters is present below:

Account ID
Merchant customer ID
First name
Last name
Email
Country
Document number
Document type
Payment method type
Payment method ID
Payment method token

You can use the Customer Object and Payment Method Object to find all the possible parameters that can be used when importing/creating customers or enrolling payment objects.
Different technical limitations associated with alternative payment methods may render them ineligible for migration between service providers. Contact the Yuno support team if you're contemplating the migration of alternative payment method tokens, such as Mercado Pago Wallet Connect, Bancolombia Tokenbox, etc., to the Yuno vault.




Data transfer security


					All data throughout the migration process is encripted and transfered using a safe method, such as SFTP.
        




Data validation
To ensure efficient processing and prevent delays, please include the following information when communicating with Support:

The external identifier name to be used for the import.
An approximate count of the expected number of payment methods to be included (a rough estimate is acceptable).
Any known data gaps, such as missing names or expiration dates.







					Yuno does not validate expiration dates during credit card import.
        




Data protection
When making payments through Yuno, the platform connects to payment processors. Yuno tokenizes and encrypts the data to ensure data security, simplifying the PCI compliance process. However, you remain responsible for managing and protecting your customer's (the buyer's) data. In addition, you are responsible for communicating any additional fees or other issues to your customer.Updated 24 days ago Table of Contents
